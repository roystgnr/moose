## MOOSE Improvements

## libMesh-level Changes

### `2024.01.04` Update

- New example illustrating a Hybridized Discontinuous Galerkin solve
- Added new finite element support: the `HIERARCHIC_VEC` FE family,
  for vector-valued hierarchic shape functions, and the
  `L2_HIERARCHIC_VEC` FE family, for the broken/L2 version of that
  space.  Added simple-vector-valued example and
  Hybridized-Discontinuous-Galerkin example runs using these families.
- Support for a pre-check object callback from PetscNonlinearSolver
- Keep track of libMesh command line queries, and avoid spurious
  unused-option warnings about them from PETSc
- Support for upgrading the order of mixed-order input meshes in
  `all_second_order()` and `all_complete_order()`
- Support for neighbor-finding and mesh stitching with mixed-order
  input meshes.  Mixed-order meshes must still be upgraded before
  being used to support C0 finite element types in a linear solve
  (where constraint equations would be needed between
  incompatible-order neighbors), but mesh generation and modification
  with pre-upgraded mixed-order meshes is now possible.
- Support for more preconditioning options in EigenSparseLinearSolver;
  this allows us to reenable a dozen examples that were previously
  skipped when Eigen was configured as the default linear algebra
  package.
- Minor fixes to reduced basis code, string parsing of uncommon
  quadrature rule names, configuration on systems without stdlib.h, 
- Minor clarifications and typo fixes in documentation, comments, and
  runtime error messages
